          <h3>2019</h3>
          <p>Born to Redefine Beauty

Back in 2019, a squad of beauty-obsessed dreamers asked the million-dollar question: Why does great makeup always come with a jaw-dropping price tag, while the budget-friendly options barely make the cut?<br>

We decided to flip the script on the beauty industry with our fresh, fearless creativity.

Our mission? To deliver products that are both "beautifully affordable and affordably beautiful" because looking fabulous shouldn't cost a fortune.</p>

          <p>Quality First, No Exceptions

SHEGLAM's secret? Since day one, we only partner with top-tier manufacturers, guaranteeing that our products meet international standards like FDA, EUCR, GSO, and ASEAN.

Plus, we conduct third-party quality inspections through agencies such as SGS and ITS. This year, we took it further by blacklisting potential risk ingredients and refining our formulas for extra safety.

While we've streamlined costs to keep our prices accessible, we never compromise on ingredient safety or product quality.!</p>
